## Description üìÉ
**Node Chat is** website built with **NodeJs & Socket. io** as a backend and using **PostgreSQL** as a DB,

**Node Chat** allows you to create an account then you can either **create a new room or join an existing one**, and rooms act like a group in any social media platform.

**the main dashboard** shows you the room you are currently in and also the ones that you can switch to and the ones that you can join.

 if you send a message to the chat using the input below, **any person in that room will receive the message and then they can text you back, when you switch to another room it won't be possible to see the message in the other room you joined.**

## Developing Details üßë‚Äçüíª

This entire website **focused more on the backend**, not the frontend, so you can see the **frontend was plain Html & Css & Javascript.**

I didn't use any frontend framework or library, and this was **because I wanted to put my effort into the backend** and try to figure out how to implement socket. io with nodejs.

**socket.*io* has great documentation** so you won't find a problem with it, and for the DB I used **Sequelize** which is a package that **makes dealing with and manipulating the data in the db much easier and cleaner.**
